# FLASK
## Image Processing Flask APP
This code is a Flask application that defines various routes for image processing. It includes the ability to upload an image, process it using a mask,
and blend it with another image. It also has a route that randomly selects an image and displays it on the home page. There are also routes for processing
images using Pygame and converting an image to a video. Additionally, there are several libraries used in the code, including subprocess, logging, and PIL.
